# Road Accident Risk Prediction

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses **Python** and **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of road accidents based on various factors such as weather, traffic conditions, and road type. By analyzing and modeling the data, the project aims to provide insights that can help reduce accident rates and improve road safety policies.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on accident datasets.
* Identify correlations between risk factors and accident severity.
* Build predictive models to estimate the probability of an accident occurring.
* Visualize the results to highlight key safety trends.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scikit-learn**

## 📁 Files in this Repository
